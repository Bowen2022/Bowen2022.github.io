               <p>Hi, I am Bowen Yang, a final-year PhD student in Civil Engineering at University of Nebraska–Lincoln <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/cee/">(UNL)</a>, supervised by Dr. <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/cee/joshua-steelman/">Joshua Steelman</a>. My dissertation committee members are: Dr. <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/cee/joshua-steelman/">Joshua Steelman</a>, Dr. <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/durhamschool/faculty/jay-puckett/">Jay Puckett</a>, Dr. <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/daniel-linzell/">Daniel Linzell</a>, Dr. <a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/durhamschool/faculty/george-morcous/">George Morcous</a>.
			   I received my master of science degree in Civil Engineering from the Penn State University <a href="https://www.cee.psu.edu/">(PSU)</a>, supervised by Dr. <a href="https://online.flipbuilder.com/wool/gsun/files/basic-html/page4.html">Jeffrey Laman</a>, who was retired in July 2021. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Bridge Engineering from Changsha University of Science and Technology (长沙理工大学).</p>


               <p>My broad areas of interest include truck platoons (a group of connected automated vehicles), structural reliability analysis, diagnostic load testing, and machine learning. My PhD research focuses on truck platoons, data driven analysis, and structural reliability analysis. In particular, I am interested in combining machine learning with civil engineering research (e.g., computer vision-based bridge monitoring, machine learning-based evaluation of bridge safety).  </p>

               <p><strong><font color='blue'>I will graduate with a PhD degree in Civil Engineering in Aug 2023. I am currently looking for a master's degree in computer science that will allow me to gain enough computer knowledge to link traditional civil engineering structures with popular machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence to reduce the likelihood of bridge collapse under heavy loads and improve the efficiency of bridge monitoring.</font></strong></p>

												<h4>Truck platoon effects on girder bridges: Service Limit State</h4>
												<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Most of the previous federated learning work has focused on a difference in the distribution of labels. Unlike those settings, we address an important problem of FL, e.g., different scanner/sensors in medical imaging, where local clients may store examples with different marginal or conditional feature distributions compared to other nodes, which we denote as feature shift non-iid.  In this work, we propose an effective method that uses local batch normalization to alleviate the feature shift before averaging models. </p>

												<h4>Truck platoon effects on girder bridges: Strength Limit State</h4>
												<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">We present a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for multi-site fMRI analysis. To overcome the domain shift issue, we have proposed two strategies: MoE and adversarial domain alignment to boost federated learning model performance.  We have shown federated learning performance can potentially be boosted by adding domain adaptation and discussed the condition of benefits. Our approach brings new hope for accelerating deep learning applications in the field of medical imaging, where data isolation and the emphasis on data privacy have become challenges.</p>

												<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> We propose to prune a target neural network with a public datasetand transfers it to the distributed learning setting to collaboratively  train  the  pruned  network  with  distributed  private datasets via sharing a hidden layer of representations, without sharing the data. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a much better trade-off between accuracy and privacy preservation.</p>
